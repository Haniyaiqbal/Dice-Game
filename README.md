Dice Game is a fun and interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). It allows two players to take turns rolling a pair of dice, and the player with the higher roll wins the round. The game's simple and intuitive interface makes it easy to play and enjoy.

Code Explanation:

The game uses JavaScript to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for each dice roll.
The random number is used to select the corresponding dice image from the "images" folder.
The image source of the dice is then updated to display the rolled number for each player.
Finally, the game compares the two rolled numbers and displays the result on the screen, declaring the winner or draw.
